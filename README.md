### Django Channels Proof of Concept

A repository to test Django Channels and WebSockets.

The idea is to send messages to WebSockets clients as some operation is executed in Django views. This will be the codebase for a real project.

#### Running this project
You must have `docker` and `docker-compose` installed. So just run `docker compose up -d --build`.
